# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.



matches:
  
# SECTION : META-SHORTCUTS
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "/Users/omarmenawi/Library/Application Support"


  - trigger: "-tri"
    replace: "- trigger: "

  - trigger: "-rep"
    replace: "  replace: "

# SECTION : LONG-WORDS

  - trigger: "aprxt"

  - trigger: "modl"
    replace: "module"

  - trigger: "t/r"
    replace: "trigger: " "
              replace: " " "


  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!


# But matches can also be dynamic:
  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params: 
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
